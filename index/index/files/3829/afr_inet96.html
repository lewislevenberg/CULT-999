I.   Introduction</b></p><p>


     The information revolution that is sweeping the 
rest of the world is now rapidly approaching Africa. 
The continent is recognizing the opportunities, challenges 
and complexities of the information society. While 
the impact of this revolution is tremendous, the existing 
infrastructure, socio-economic, cultural and political 
situations pose major difficulties in introducing, 
implementing and diffusing new technologies for Internetworking. 
The major problems are not technical but managerial, 
political, cultural and also due to a lack of resources. 
 Thus, Africa needs to find its own solutions to local 
problems. Seizing the opportunities of global networking 
would allow the region to fight poverty and ignorance 
from all direction.</p><p>


     In order to make connectivity a reality and useful 
tool to local centered development, local actors should 
develop capacity to implement networks that address 
the day to day problems.  The private sector should 
assume the major role in establish networks in Africa. 
  Local solutions, on the other hand, require actions 
by governments and the support of the international 
organizations.</p><p>


     African participants of the Inet'96 workshop of 
countries in early stage of internetworking introduced 
and reviewed the current problems in networking in 
African countries at two informal sessions.  Discussion 
also centered around unique strategies to resolve these 
problems and some participants were able to reccommend 
concrete actions which could be undertaken immediately. 
The following sections briefly summarizes these sessions.<b></b></p><p><b>


II. Current Internetworking problems in Africa</b></p><p>


     African connectivity problems are the result of 
peculiar socio-economic conditions in the region. Many 
nations continue to suffer from badly performing economies, 
high foreign debt, declining resources and social infrastructures, 
alarming population growth, increased dependency, degradation 
of the environment and other debilitating ailments. 
 These have direct implication on the implementation 
of networking projects and the type of public policies 
that foster connectivity in Africa.</p><p>


     Some countries in Africa still remained unconnected 
to the most basic forms of store and forward technologies 
such as uucp. Others continue to link via fledgling 
public networks without proper management strategies 
and private sector involvement. Those connected to 
full IP s (Internet Providers) score the least density 
in the world.  Some of the problems that hinder the 
deployment of connectivity in the region include:<b></b></p><p><b>


 (i) Lack of information coordination</b></p><p>


     A number of networking projects have made substantial 
efforts to set up grassroots links in Africa.  However, 
many steps are redundantly duplicated due to a lack 
of mutual national, sub- regional, regional and international 
coordination. "Everyone wants to coordinate, but 
no one wants to be coordinated". This peculiar 
problem is compounded by lack of qualitative information 
on connectivity, i.e., (Who is doing what? What are 
the costs.  What are the plans? etc.)<b></b></p><p><b>


 (ii) Lack of coordination of physical connections</b></p><p>


     Except in southern Africa the majority of links 
from Africa connect via Europe and North America. There 
are a number of situations where national networks 
connect to each other via intermediaries in Europe 
or North America. A message that would have taken less 
than five minutes by taxi takes a full day to arrive 
via email.  Some are even jokingly referring to email 
systems in Africa as  snail mail  systems.  At the 
sub-regional and regional levels there are no plans 
for backbones that interconnect African countries. 
Lack of adequate technical knowledge to develop gateways 
between these links, competition for resources and 
donor requirements is making it difficult to develop 
active collaboration.<b></b></p><p><b>


 (iii). Lack of technical personnel cooperation</b></p><p>


     The networking of trained individuals is very critical 
for regional cooperation.  Cooperation and coordination 
of system managers and the advocates of networking 
have been less successful in Africa.  Technical personnel 
have also been unable to coordinate networking activities 
and were less interactive during the last five years. 
There have not been a sufficient amount of forums to 
bring the majority of network managers together except 
at  a few sparkling examples like the Inet workshops, 
and also Telematics Symposium held in Addis Ababa, 
April 1995.<b></b></p><p><b>


(iv) Information poverty and non-availability via networks</b></p><p>


     The major bottleneck and a  cause of stagnation 
to the development of technological networking in Africa 
has been its weak information infrastructure.  Strategic 
information for better health, functioning industry, 
prompt social services, transparent governance, sustainable 
environment and development are non- existent. Africa 
continues to depend on the North for its own local 
information. This dependency needs to be reversed. 
On the other hand, the "NET" itself is becoming 
a widely used mechanism for the xchange of information. 
 Nevertheless, it is often difficult to find relevant 
information in very short time.  It  can take long 
periods of time before information is retrieved from 
the Web.  This is very costly for African networks 
who can not afford to waste scarce bandwidth surfing 
on the Web.<b></b></p><p><b>


(v) Telecommunications monopoly and obsolete regulatory 
frameworks</b></p><p>


     The networking problem in Africa generally stems 
from obsolete policies and negative regulatory frameworks 
by governments. Telecommunications is a public (government) 
property in many countries. PT&amp;Ts consider networking 
as a sole government job without competition. Government 
owned telecommunication operators are usually inefficient. 
 Commercial service providers are not allowed to provide 
value added services. Furthermore, it is often very 
difficult to alter these longstanding attitudes. The 
majority of African governments still require longer 
time to understand the value of networking offers to 
their competitiveness and its abilities to foster positive 
changes in quality of life. Issues such as cultural 
erosion, pornography, privacy, security, loss of revenue 
are often amplified by  government controlled media 
 as opposed to promoting empowerment via networks.<b></b></p><p><b>


(vi). Minimum involvement of research institutions in 
network building and diffusion in Africa</b></p><p>


     Most projects in Africa have centered around NGOs 
and private sectors without the involvement of the 
academic community. The research and academic community 
that would have been a vehicle for the development 
of the Internet through teaching and multiplying technical 
capacity has been overlooked during the last five years. 
Users from the academic community were unable to effectively 
exploit networking.  The local information economies 
require advances in the local capacity for software 
research and development.  African countries can become 
full actors in the area of software development if 
considerable attention is given to this area.<b></b></p><p><b>


(vii). Unreliable telecommunication infrastructures</b></p><p>


     In addition to high tariffs and non-favorable traffic, 
African telecommunication infrastructures remain unreliable. 
 Many countries still use analog links that are difficult 
to integrate to newer communication technologies. Other 
innovative telecom networks that bypass local analog 
loops are unavailable and the licensing processes for 
them are antiquated.<b></b></p><p><b>


(viii) Language barriers</b></p><p>


     The diversity of African communities poses a difficulty 
in integrating them to the net culture. Language and 
illiteracy are central to this problem.  Most countries 
use different languages other than English. Network 
user interfaces to these languages are unavailable 
and developments in transliteration are in very early 
stages.<b></b></p><p><b>


(ix) Different network technologies, topologies and 
protocols</b></p><p>


     The availability of different protocols (often 
more than four in each country) poses difficulty in 
maintaining links between local links. Some proprietary 
network protocols are still difficult to link to open 
standard links.<b></b></p><p><b>


III. Proposed solutions to interconnectivity  problems 
in Africa</b></p><p>


     African solutions to networking are generally country 
specific. Therefore, any attempted solutions must incorporate 
strategies can be applied to each African country. 
Training and sensitization are both fundamental to 
bring changes in Africa. All opportunities including 
ISOC workshops should be used to provide basic, advanced 
and system administration training to users, policy 
makers and system managers. National training is usually 
most effective and more local training will sustain 
the national links.</p><p>


      The following ideas were proposed as partial solutions 
to networking problems in Africa:<b></b></p><p><b>


(i) Better coordination between donors, local actors 
and government</b></p><p>


     There are often number of projects running parallel 
in the same institutions or town without knowledge 
of the existence of the other. Better coordination 
between donors, local actors and government s is important 
to sustain connectivity projects.  A national repository 
of information is perhaps the most useful tool for 
coordination.<b></b></p><p><b>


 (ii) Creation of national, regional and sub-regional 
forums</b></p><p>


     Interaction between local actors, system managers 
and project implementors is of great importance to 
foster collaboration within Africa and to reduce duplication 
of efforts. Technical solutions are often miles away. 
Interaction entails formation of user groups, networked 
forums, listserves, on-line conferences and physical 
contacts via workshops, symposiums and conferences.<b></b></p><p><b>


(iii) Technical cooperation</b></p><p>


     Maintaining technical cooperation between network 
operators sysops, network mangers etc.) in Africa via 
 existing and new listserves and on-line conferences 
is invaluable to improve the sharing of regional experience 
and knowledge. Networking makes the sharing of knowledge, 
scarce resources and time easier. Listserves, existing 
conferences and echoes can be used to link up local 
and regional network gurus. Horizontal technical cooperation 
should be encouraged between African countries in the 
area of training where advanced countries share their 
experiences in running various technologies.</p><p>


(iv) Mechanism for close collaboration between technical 
personnel and decision makers should be established</p><p>


     In addition to the interaction between system operators, 
a mechanism for vertical communication between technical 
personnel and decision makers should be established. 
Network personnel and advocates should be able to influence 
decision makers. This may be through the formation 
of local user and advisory groups.</p><p>


(v)  Focus should be made in improving training specially 
in francophone and lusophone countries in Africa</p><p>


     Training and human resource development is central 
to building the capacity of African countries. Local 
private firms, academic institutions and users at large 
should be trained on various aspects of networking 
and information dissemination via networks. Training 
should also be tailored to address diversity in languages 
and French, Swahili Arabic and Portuguese speaking 
countries should be able to benefit from these training 
in their own local languages. Efforts by Internet Society 
to introduce workshop tracks for French speaking countries 
should be encouraged. ISOC should mount regional training 
for Africa.<b></b></p><p><b>


(vi) Set up ISOC African chapter</b></p><p>


     As in the case of other countries African chapters 
should be established in the ISOC structure. This would 
extend the Society's purposes by serving the interests 
of African communities through a local presence, focus 
on local issues and developments, use of local languages. 
The African chapters statement of purpose would include 
assisting the expansion of the Internet, improving 
awareness through sensitization and training in collaboration 
of ISOC headquarters, voicing the concerns and needs 
of local communities.</p><p>


(vii) Organization of training on Internet at national 
level by trainees from Inet workshop      Since Internet 
workshops are for trainers and system managers, the 
trend should not end at ISOC workshops. African trainees 
should mount national workshops on the Internet every 
year. This will improve expansion of Internet community 
at the local level. There is also a need for mounting 
sub-regional and regional training.<b></b></p><p><b>


(vii) Enhancing local interconnectivity</b></p><p>


     Network projects should focus on diffusion of connectivity 
at local level. This will reduce availability of links 
to a privileged few and  enhance abilities to reach 
that "last mile".</p><p>


(ix) Establishment of national data bases on connectivity</p><p>


     Connectivity data on Africa is full of errors and 
inconsistencies. This is due to lack of timely information, 
less cooperation from system managers, new and unnoticed 
links and system improvements. The majority of suppliers 
of information that relates to connectivity are located 
in other parts of the world. This suggests a need for 
a creation of national connectivity databases that 
can be available via network tools (mailing list, listserve, 
WWW etc.) to the global community and to international 
connectivity lists maintained by various institutions. 
Decentralizing the current network databases on country 
levels is important to accommodate the increasing volume 
of data on links, costs, plans and technical topologies.<b></b></p><p><b>


(x) Establishment of a regional  and sub-regional backbone</b></p><p>


     African countries should begin to group their efforts 
to set up network backbones. Sub-regional backbones 
have already been under discussion. Close collaboration 
for set up regional and sub- regional backbones are 
essential.</p><p>


(xi) Emphasis on collecting, organizing and publishing 
local information and making it available on the network</p><p>


     In addition to improving connectivity,  Africa 
needs to move towards building its own content on the 
net. This involves training in new ways for information 
gathering and presentation. The development of net 
"meta information" (information on information 
on the net) is crucial to optimize the use of scarce 
bandwidth and to get pertinent information to users 
that are not connected.</p><p>


(xii) Development of national information and communication 
plans for every country in Africa</p><p>


     In view of efforts in building African Information 
Society (there are already initiatives by UNECA), every 
African country should chart its road map towards building 
national information infrastructure.</p><p>


(xiii) Liberalization of telecommunications and public 
broadcasting services</p><p>


     Unless efforts are made to liberalize public telecommunication 
and broadcasting services the majority of African countries 
will remain in vicious circles of poverty. Public broadcasting 
and telecommunication services are carriers of information 
that empowers African citizens. In addition to liberalizing 
existing networks, PT&amp;Ts should be able to open 
up for licensing innovative communication links such 
as VSAT and other alternative technologies such as 
radios.</p><p>


(xiv) Enhancing the role of the media in diffusion of 
Internet connectivity</p><p>


     African media should be supported and introduced 
to advancing Internet technologies. The role of media 
in diffusing connectivity is tremendous. Project implementors 
and local champions should seize every opportunities 
to broadcast the impact of IP link on the community 
through the media. African media should be involved 
in using networks.</p><p>


(xv) Development of strategies to support academic and 
research institutions to have access to communication 
technologies</p><p>


     There is an urgent need to support African universities 
to improve teaching and research in the fields of communication 
and computing technologies. This would improve local 
capacity, access to networks and multiply connectivity 
using students. Focus should be made on key areas such 
as software development and unix systems administration. 
Here Africa still faces the largest qualitative. This 
is the area that most countries can leapfrog.</p><p>


(xvi) Enhance research in language interfaces and forums 
in multiple languages</p><p>


     User interfaces development and research  in various 
languages is critical to enhance access to local communities. 
Multiple language forums would also enhance the cultural 
exchange and interaction between different language 
users.</p><p>


     A new way of looking at African information supply 
is also essential. Training in new methods of information 
organization is far too critical for successful connectivity 
in the region. This means training in hypertext tools 
and information generation and organization in various 
formats.</p><p>


     The role of the private sector is crucial to African 
connectivity. Aggressive private sector involvement 
in connectivity would substitute for lack of marketing 
strategy in public networks. Private isnstitutions 
are also key to sustaining national networks.<b></b></p><p><b>


 IV. Proposed actions and conclusions</b></p><p>


     It was proposed that concrete actions by donor 
agencies, international non-governmental organizations, 
network champions and governments are essential to 
enhancing connectivity in Africa. They should implement 
the solutions to African connectivity problems described 
above.</p><p>


     The following actions were proposed during the 
meeting on Africa at the Inte'96 conference.      </p><p>

- develop strategies for training government officials 
,universities, and research units on the     use of 
the technology and its impact on organizations.</p><p>


     - strengthen and sustain existing training capacity 
scattered throughout the region covering     wide range 
of users including technicians (use INET workshop models),</p><p>

     admintartors to sstain services and users on best 
practices and optimum usage of the "net".</p><p>


     - work on African IP registry</p><p>


     - work on the establishment of African Internet 
Group similar      to the Asian Internet Group that 
would meet during Inet      workshops</p><p>


     - establishing African ISOC chapter</p><p>


     Donors were urged to improve collaboration between 
each other because interaction between donors and local 
actors is extremely important. They should recognize 
diversity to come up with different solutions for different 
African countries and play key roles in development 
of national information infrastructure road maps in 
African countries.</p><p>


     NGOS and International organizations are also requested 
to assist African network actors in their efforts to 
deal with national policies. Organizations such as 
the United Nations and ITU should exert pressure on 
governments to liberalize telecommunications and broadcasting 
services. NGOs and international organizations are 
crucial in setting up start up networks.</p><p>


     The champions of networking in Africa should interact 
and exchange ideas. Governments should open up to the 
changes in the global processes and information societies. 
African connectivity is not just for a link between 
people and networks; it is a tool for fighting underdevelopment.</p><p>
