    2010-2011 Annual Report

Project: Ghana Open Data Initiative (GODI)

 
Summary

    Project : Ghana Open Data Initiative (GODI)
    Summary : Support the Government of Ghana to create a locally sustainable long-term Open Data Initiative.
    Partners :  Web Foundation ,  National Information and Technology Agency (NITA) , and the cooperation of many organizations within the country.
    Status : January 2012 through December 2013.
    Funding : The project originated from discussions started during the  feasibility study  and is funded by NITA.

 

In August 2010, the Web Foundation started a project to conduct an assessment of the feasibility and potential of establishing an Open Data Initiative (ODI) in two countries: Ghana and Chile. The feasibility reports were  published in draft form  in February 2011 and open for comments for several weeks. The  final versions  were published in May 2011.

The Ministry of Communications through the  National Information and Technology Agency (NITA)  engaged the Web Foundation over the following few months in discussions over the feasibility report and its recommendations. In the meantime, the roll-out of the  eGovernment Network Infrastructure (GovNET)  across the 10 regions in Ghana was completed. With the GovNET in place, data collection and dissemination by Ministries, Departments and Agencies will be easier and will spark of innovation and development with reuse of data so disseminated.

In January 2012,  NITA invited the Web Foundation to Accra , to hold brainstorming meetings, a meeting with stakeholders, and kick-start the project in Accra.

 
Approach

The Web Foundation will support NITA in 2012-2013 to perform the following actions:

    Development of an Open Data strategy for the Government of Ghana taking into account the three layers of actors (political, public administration and civil society) and six dimensions of Open Data (political, legal, organizational, technical, social and economic). The strategy will include:
        Public policy guidelines
        Data collection guidelines
        Data copyright and licensing guidelines
        Dataset publication process/Open Data methods
        GODI Secretariat/Steering Committee guidelines
        Public-Private focus groups guidelines
    Establishment of an Open Data community
        Intra and extra-government community building and outreach
        One-time events and regular events (workshops, bootcamps, barcamps, contestsâ¦)
        Collaborative online tools
    Setup, development and deployment of an Open Data platform (Web site)
        Requirements and standards
        Implementation
        Validation
    Monitoring and Evaluation of the GODI
        Methodology
        Impact assessment
        Tools

Expected Outcomes

The expected outcome of this project is the establishment of a sustainable Open Data ecosystem in Ghana that will serve as a shining example for others to replicate.
Status

The final results are expected by December 2013 but the project will follow an ongoing delivery, monitoring and evaluation process.
