<p><a name="1. introduction"><font face="Times New Roman Bold" size="4"><b>1. Introduction</b></font></a></p>

<p>Nigeria, like most developing countries, is an
"information-poor" country. The sparsity of published
current information is particularly acute in the informatics
area, which is still in its infancy. Ideally, this report should
have been based on a recent nationwide survey, but such a survey
could not be undertaken for lack of time and other resources.
Consequently the author has had to rely on readily available
material and on his personal observations and general impression
of the informatics scene in Nigeria. It is hoped nevertheless
that the picture drawn here is a balanced and reasonably accurate
one.</p>

<p>This section supplies essential background information on
Nigeria, gives an overview of IT activity in the country, and
outlines the structure of the report.</p>

<p><i>Background Data on Nigeria</i></p>

<p><i>Geography</i></p>

<p>The Federal Republic of Nigeria is situated on the West
African coast between latitudes 5�N and 14�N, and between
longitudes 2�E and 14�E. Covering an area of some 924,000 km<sup>2</sup>,
the country is bounded in the south by the Atlantic Ocean, and
shares common borders with the Benin Republic in the west, with
Niger to the north, with the Chad Republic to the north-east, and
with the Cameroon Republic to the east. Nigeria is the most
populous state in Africa, with a mid-1985 population of
95,198,000 (one out of every six Africans is a Nigerian), and the
tenth largest in the world.</p>

<p>The climate is wholly tropical. There are basically two
seasons: a wet season lasting from April to September, and a dry
season lasting from October to March. All the rainfall occurs in
the hot and humid wet season. In the dry season, the harmattan
wind blows from the Sahara desert, bringing a cloud of very fine
dust to most areas.</p>

<p><i>Politics</i></p>

<p>Nigeria emerged from British colonial rule in 196O, and for 19
of its 29 years of existence as an independent state has been
under military rule - a legacy of no fewer than six <i>coups
d'�tat</i>. The present military regime headed by a president,
General Ibrahim Babangida, came to power in 1985 after toppling a
military predecessor. The government has embarked on a transition
programme to return the nation to civilian rule in 1992.</p>

<p><i>Economy</i></p>

<p>The major economic indicators are summarized in table 3.1. The
most significant economic event in the country is arguably the
discovery, in 1956, of crude oil in commercial quantity in the
area of the Niger delta. Thereafter, exploration and mining
operations, carried out initially by international oil companies
such as Shell and BP, were intensified, and the first consignment
of crude oil was exported in 1958. In 1976, the Nigerian National
Petroleum Company (NNPC) was incorporated to engage in
exploration, production, and processing activities side by side
with the multinationals. Soon, oil became the nation's principal
dollar earner, contributing, since the 1970s, to more than 80 per
cent of total export revenue (95.1 per cent in 1984).</p>

<p>However, with the collapse of the international oil market
starting about 1982, the economy entered a period of rapid
decline. For example, GDP per capita declined in real terms by
more than 27 per cent in the five years 19801985, and export
earnings fell to less than half in the same period. The nation is
overburdened with a huge international debt, interest payments on
which account for as much as 50 per cent of the country's total
foreign exchange earnings. The national currency, the Naira, has
been devalued by more than 90 per cent since 1980, and inflation
is running at the rate of more than 50 per cent per annum. (The
value of the Naira is subject to considerable fluctuation; in
July 1989, its value in relation to the US dollar was $1.00 =
N7.22.)</p>

<p>In 1986, the Babangida administration, in a bid to address the
ever-worsening economic situation, introduced a package of
austerity measures, which have come to be called the Structural
Adjustment Programme (SAP). Whatever the theoretical merits of
SAP, it has brought about a severe lowering of the living
standards of the Nigerian wage or salary earner, a fact that
triggered the anti-SAP riots that swept the whole country early
in June 1989.</p>

<p><i>Education</i></p>

<p>During the period of the oil boom, Nigeria experienced a
tremendous boost in the provision of educational institutions,
though this was not actually matched by the provision of relevant
physical facilities. Thus, between 1975 and 1983, primary school
enrolment more than doubled while the enrolment in both secondary
and tertiary institutions increased nearly five-fold (see table
3.2). Today there are more than 25 universities, most of which
are federally supported. There are also scores of polytechnics,
technical colleges, and colleges of education.</p>

<p>Education has been badly affected by SAP. Institutions at all
levels are today too ill equipped in terms of physical facilities
and recurrent funds to serve their educational purpose with any
degree of credibility.</p>

<p><i>Industry</i></p>

<p>The prosperity brought about by the oil boom stimulated a high
level of demand among the Nigerian populace for modern consumer
goods. This in turn led to the setting up of a large number of
manufacturing industries operating on an import-substitution
basis. By 1980 there were well over 3,000 industrial
establishments engaged in a wide spectrum of activities, ranging
from the extraction and refining of minerals, through food
processing and brewing, to the manufacture of a variety of
intermediate goods.<sup>1</sup> The impressive list of goods
manufactured in Nigeria includes: dairy products; canned fruit,
fruit juices, and preserves; refined vegetable oil; processed
foods; beers and stout; sugar and confectionery; tobacco
products; drugs and medicines; textiles and leather goods; paper
products; industrial chemicals, fertilizers, and pesticides;
paints and cosmetics; rubber and plastic products including tubes
and tyres; cement; structural steels and other metal products;
motor vehicle assembly and spare parts; electrical appliances,
electrical cables, radio and television sets.</p>

<p>In the prevailing climate of economic recession, marked by
scarcity of foreign exchange and a rapidly depreciating value of
the Naira, many industries have had to either close down, or
operate well below capacity, for want of raw materials or spare
parts. A recent survey carried out by the Manufacturers'
Association of Nigeria showed that the average industrial
capacity utilization in the second half of 1988 was 40 per cent,
compared with 35 per cent in the first half of the same year.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p><i>Agriculture</i></p>

<p>Agriculture, which in the 1960s used to be the mainstay of the
economy, suffered a considerable decline in the 1970s and early
1980s as a result of the expansion in the oil sector. In 1982,
agriculture contributed only 1 per cent to total export earnings.
The decline in agriculture was accompanied by a massive growth in
the food import bill. Ironically, the vast majority of Nigerians
still live in rural areas and are dependent on peasant farming.
Successive governments have, since the 1980s, sought to restore
agriculture to its former role and make the nation once again
self-sufficient in the production of the staple foods. The
importation of grains such as rice and wheat has been banned,
without viable alternatives in some cases, e.g. wheat.</p>

<p><i>IT Overview</i></p>

<p>For the purposes of this report we shall adopt Drew's
definition in chapter 1 of this volume (p. 10) of the term
information technology (IT) to include all those computer-based
activities that derive from the convergent disciplines of
micro-electronics, computing, and telecommunications, and that
have led to the reorganization of the processes of production,
distribution, and circulation in society. Implicit in this
definition is the notion of information as an important resource
that may be generated, shared, and utilized in decision-making.
Drew further groups the application of IT into four categories
summarized as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>(1) applications that introduce computing power to the
    industrial process; <br>
    (2) use of digital techniques in communications;<br>
    (3) office automation including banking;<br>
    (4) micro-electronics in consumer products.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Nigeria hitherto, the first category has not occurred in
any innovative, self-reliant way. Advanced factory installations
built in Nigeria, usually on a turnkey basis, frequently involve
process computers as an integral part of the plant. Examples are
found in the oil industry and in the iron and steel plants. Their
influence on indigenous technology had until recently been fairly
limited. There are signs however that, pressed by SAP, industries
are beginning to show more interest in this area.</p>

<p>Public data communication services have not yet arrived in
Nigeria. Private companies are meeting their needs for data
transmission on a "do-it-yourself" basis using the
analogue facilities of the Nigeria Telecommunications Co.
(NITEL), the nation's postal, telegraph, and telephone
administration.</p>

<p>As for the fourth category, namely consumer electronics, there
is as yet no autonomous electronics industry in Nigeria.
Consequently, in the context of innovative and self-reliant uses
of IT in Nigeria, this report will, in the main, be concerned
with the first and the third categories.</p>

<p><i>Outline of the Report</i></p>

<p>Section 2 of the report discusses the growth of information
technology (really, the growth of computer usage) in Nigeria.
Information is given on the diffusion of computers in various
sectors of the economy, the number of installations, and the
types and brands of computers in common use.</p>

<p>Section 3 discusses the issue of a national IT policy. It is
shown that, while the use of computers has been growing steadily
in the public sector and government has from time to time made
pronouncements on computers and related subjects, there is no IT
policy in Nigeria that can be properly so called.</p>

<p>Section 4 is devoted to a discussion of the status and
prospects of the computer services industry in Nigeria. Ideas
being floated on the manufacture of computers or related hardware
components and the setting up of a software industry in Nigeria
are also discussed.</p>

<p>Section 5 is devoted to the telecommunications infrastructure.
Data on the current state of the telephone network are given, as
are current developments in the area of data networks in the
banking and the oil industries.</p>

<p>Section 6 focuses on the pattern of application of IT in the
various sectors of the economy with special emphasis on industry
and the service sector, and section 7 deals with the important
issue of IT education and training in Nigeria.</p>

<p>Section 8 contains the summary and the main conclusions of the
report.</p>
