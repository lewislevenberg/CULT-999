Figure 1 shows the rapid growth in investment with private participation in African telecommunications from 2000 to 2007. Resource scarce landlocked countries in Sub-Saharan Africa attract the lowest volume of investment. These countries have much lower levels of income, larger rural populations, and lower educational levels than other regions. Oil producer Nigeria has been increasing its dominance, and in 2007 accounted for well over half of total investment in resource rich countries. South Africa’s contribution to the resource scarce coastal total has been falling. Between 2000 and 2003, South Africa accounted for 60&nbsp;per cent of average investment. From 2004 to 2007 this decreased to 22 per cent. North African countries which have higher levels of income and a smaller rural population, accounted on average for 44&nbsp;per cent of investment in Africa from 2004 to 2007. </p> <p>Overall investment with private involvement represented an average 1.3&nbsp;per cent of Africa’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) between 2004 and 2007. In absolute terms, in 2004-2007 Africa attracted on average 2004-2007 USD&nbsp;11.5&nbsp;billion, behind OECD and Central Asia with USD&nbsp;19&nbsp;billion and Latin America and Caribbean with USD&nbsp;13.3&nbsp;billion, and slightly ahead of South Asia with USD&nbsp;10.8&nbsp;billion. East Asia and Pacific countries lagged behind on USD 5.3 &nbsp;billion. Most African countries have extremely low rates of access to ICT services, however, compared to other world regions. According to the Networked Readiness Index 2007-2008 developed by the World Economic Forum and L’Institut Européen d’Administration des Affaires (INSEAD), Sub-Saharan African countries came bottom of the worldwide rankings. North African countries ranked higher, particularly Tunisia with Egypt and Morocco improving their scores. South Africa and Mauritius led the Sub-Saharan rankings.</p><div class="csc-textpic csc-textpic-center csc-textpic-above"><div class="csc-textpic-imagewrap"><div class="csc-textpic-center-outer"><div class="csc-textpic-center-inner"><figure class="csc-textpic-image csc-textpic-last"><img src="csm_Overview_Part2_1_e7d4a74ffd.jpg" alt="" title="Overview Part2 1"></figure></div></div></div></div><h2>Access to information technology: Africa in the world rankings</h2><p>Africa has the lowest internet penetration rate in the world (see Figure&nbsp;2). In Sub-Saharan African countries, for internet users the penetration rate is below 7 per cent and for broadband it is under <br>1 per cent. In Latin America and Caribbean, and East Asia and Pacific countries, the figure is around 20&nbsp;per cent for internet users. North African countries are relatively better-off than Sub-Saharan counterparts with a rate of 40.4&nbsp;per cent. However, even in North Africa the penetration rate for broadband subscribers is only 2&nbsp;per cent. In Europe, in contrast broadband penetration is about 15&nbsp;per cent. In Africa most internet is by low speed dial-up connections which are concentrated in Egypt, Kenya and South Africa. Faster speed broadband connections through Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Lines (ADSL) are found in South Africa, Egypt, Morocco and Algeria. </p> <p>The penetration of fixed-line services varies significantly. In some North African countries there is a penetration rate of up to 32&nbsp;per cent, while in Sub-Saharan Africa it can be as low as 3&nbsp;per cent and this is a major cause of the current difficulties of fixed-line operators. In other regions of the world, fixed-line operators had a strong base when mobile penetration arrived. In Africa, the low penetration rate and limited availability of fixed lines made it easier for new mobile entrants to make an impact. </p> <p>Africa had the world’s fastest growth in new mobile phones in 2008. In some Sub-Saharan countries there was growth of about 40&nbsp;per cent yet overall penetration rates remain low. North African countries, on the other hand, are reaching mature levels with an average penetration rate of 93&nbsp;per cent, so their average annual growth rate is down to 19&nbsp;per cent. There are also significant differences between Sub-Saharan countries, with penetration rates in resource rich and resource scarce coastal countries at about 50&nbsp;per cent, compared to 15&nbsp;per cent in resource scarce landlocked countries. </p> <p>Among the big coastal African nations, Nigeria (60&nbsp;million), South Africa (47&nbsp;million), Egypt (37&nbsp;million), Algeria (31&nbsp;million) and Morocco (24&nbsp;million) had the biggest number of subscribers in 2008. Among the landlocked countries, Sudan, Congo and Uganda share the first three places with 10, 8 and 7&nbsp;million subscribers respectively. With Tunisia’s market of 9&nbsp;million subscribers, four North African countries are among the largest mobile markets in Africa. </p> <p>But when using market penetration as the measure, Libya, Cape Verde and Comoros have the highest coverage among coastal countries, having reached levels above 100&nbsp;per cent in 2008. Similar levels have also been reached by Gabon, Algeria and Tunisia. In contrast, in the landlocked countries, the three best performing nations, Lesotho, Sudan and Mali, barely average penetration rates of 25&nbsp;per cent. At the other end of the scale, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia with a combined population of 92&nbsp;million people have a penetration rate of just 3.4&nbsp;per cent. Burundi, Central African Republic and Rwanda have between 5 and 10 percent. </p> <p>Operators have concentrated investment on second generation networks in Africa and they will now probably recover this money before getting into third generation high speed networks, even if licences are being granted. As of early 2009 there were only 5&nbsp;million subscribers — 2.3 per cent of the total subscribers in Africa — for services with Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) and WCDMA High Speed Packet Access (HSPA). The heaviest investment has been in South Africa. The country has three WCDMA and two WCDMA HSPA networks that in 2008 accounted for 45&nbsp;per cent of third generation network connections in Africa. South Africa, <a href="http://www.africaneconomicoutlook.org/en/theme/ict-africa/technology-infrastructure-and-services-in-africa/box-3-south-south-co-operation-large-scale-broadband-wireless-network/" title="Opens internal link in current window" class="internal-link">Libya</a> and Egypt make up to 82&nbsp;per cent of third generation connections in Africa. </p> <p>Second generation Global System for Mobile (GSM) communications account for 96&nbsp;per cent of subscriptions. Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology is only used by 1.5&nbsp;per cent, but some operators such as Expresso in Sudan have adopted CDMA because it requires less capital investments.</p><div class="csc-textpic csc-textpic-center csc-textpic-above"><div class="csc-textpic-imagewrap"><div class="csc-textpic-center-outer"><div class="csc-textpic-center-inner"><figure class="csc-textpic-image csc-textpic-last"><img src="csm_Overview_Part2_2_f2ab9455e6.jpg" alt="" title="Overview Part2 2"></figure></div></div></div></div><div class="csc-textpic csc-textpic-center csc-textpic-above"><div class="csc-textpic-imagewrap"><div class="csc-textpic-center-outer"><div class="csc-textpic-center-inner"><figure class="csc-textpic-image csc-textpic-last"><img src="csm_Overview_Part2_3_333d5083cc.jpg" alt="" title="Overview Part2 3"></figure></div></div></div></div><h2>Connecting Africa to the World</h2><p>Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest internet prices in the world. According to International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and World Bank estimates, the average price of a broadband connection in Sub-Saharan Africa is about USD&nbsp;110 for 100 kilobit per second. In Europe and Central Asia the price was USD&nbsp;20 while in Latin America and the Caribbean it was USD&nbsp;7. Middle East and North African countries also pay below USD&nbsp;30. </p> <p>But there is huge potential demand. A 2006-2007 study of 16 Sub-Saharan countries found that in Cameroon, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal and South Africa more than 10&nbsp;per cent of the surveyed population use internet. There is a large potential for growth since internet awareness remains very low. In Burkina Faso, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Uganda and Mozambique, less than 10&nbsp;per cent of the surveyed population knew what internet is. In Namibia, Ghana, Botswana, Benin and Côte d’Ivoire, less than 30 per cent knew what internet is. The telecommunications industry is investing in international bandwidth to meet this potential demand and has currently reached annual growth rates of 96&nbsp;per cent, compared to a global average of 51&nbsp;per cent, according to the Telegeography 2008 survey. </p> <p>The low internet penetration rates and high tariffs stem mainly from a lack of high-capacity international networks (see Figure&nbsp;4). This allows operators to charge prices far above the marginal cost of the service. There is currently only one submarine fibre optic cable off the West Africa coast, SAT-3, that provides a high quality international service and access is limited to members of the consortium which built the link in 2002. Since mid-2007 operators can purchase capacity at tariffs that have been as high as USD&nbsp;25&nbsp;000 per mega bit per second (MBPS) each month and now range between USD&nbsp;2 000 and USD&nbsp;10 000 MBPS per month as the cable operators anticipate new competition. Depending on the volume of traffic, South Africa´s wholesale prices are lower while Cameroon and Gabon pay the highest tariffs. Except for Ghana and Benin, it is often impossible to buy a link to SAT-3 and so it has unused capacity. </p> <p>Africa relies on satellites and Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) earth stations for most of its connectivity. This results in high prices — though tariffs often of USD&nbsp;3 000 – USD&nbsp;5 000 are often lower than SAT-3 — and the applications are slow compared to other technologies. A web page request can take up to 16 seconds to complete. Intelsat, the world’s largest commercial satellite service provider, provides full coverage in Africa. Thuraya, which has Middle East and North African telecommunications and investment companies as shareholders, gives coverage to North and Central Africa. </p> <p>Moves are being made in west, east and southern Africa to increase the international networks (see Figure&nbsp;5). But for now, East and Southern Africa relies on satellites and has just 0.07&nbsp;per cent of the world’s international bandwidth capacity. The 10&nbsp;000 kilometer long East Africa Submarine Cable System (EASSy) was to connect 21 countries from South Africa to Sudan by 2008. Prices were expected to fall to USD&nbsp;500 - USD&nbsp;1 500 per Mbps/month under an open-access scheme where every service provider could purchase at the same price, whether or not they were investors. The USD&nbsp;263&nbsp;million project has suffered delays largely due to disagreements over management of the consortium. </p> <p>While EASSy has been delayed, other projects have advanced. <a href="http://www.africaneconomicoutlook.org/en/theme/ict-africa/technology-infrastructure-and-services-in-africa/box-4-seacom-private-african-investment-running-ahead/" title="Opens internal link in current window" class="internal-link">Seacom</a> is a 17 000 kilometer submarine fibre optic cable costing USD&nbsp;650&nbsp;million scheduled to launch in June 2009 and link South Africa with Mumbai in India, Marseille in France and London via Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique and Madagascar. Kenya is also working with Etisalat to connect its coastal city of Mombasa to Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates. Alcatel-Lucent has been awarded USD&nbsp;82&nbsp;million to lay the 4 500 km fibre-optic cable for the East African Marine System (TEAMS). SEACOM and TEAMS will begin operations in Kenya in the second quarter of 2009 with an open access policy and prices of USD&nbsp;500 -USD&nbsp;1&nbsp;000 per MBPS/month. </p> <p>The World Bank has allotted USD&nbsp;424&nbsp;million to <a href="http://www.africaneconomicoutlook.org/en/theme/ict-africa/technology-infrastructure-and-services-in-africa/box-5-regional-integration-in-landlocked-countries/" title="Opens internal link in current window" class="internal-link">boosting regional networks</a> in eastern and southern Africa under the Regional Communications Infrastructure Programme (RCIP) which it hopes will increase traffic by at least 36&nbsp;per cent a year and cut bandwidth costs by one tenth. Kenya, Burundi and Madagascar are involved in the first phase of RCIP, involving USD&nbsp;164.5&nbsp;million. By the end of the programme, it is expected that all capitals and major cities in eastern and southern Africa would be linked to competitively priced high bandwidth. The RCIP accounts for more than 10&nbsp;per cent of total World Bank support to Africa. The African Development Bank (AfDB) is also <a href="http://www.africaneconomicoutlook.org/en/theme/ict-africa/technology-infrastructure-and-services-in-africa/box-6-afdb%e2%80%99s-support-to-ict-african-capitals-connected-by-fibre-optic-in-2012/" title="Opens internal link in current window" class="internal-link">helping infrastructure development.</a> </p> <p>On the West coast, Ghana, Nigeria and Senegal have the most significant potential demand for international capacity. Up to seven investment groups have said they would add international capacity in the region but only a few will succeed. Globacom, the second oldest operator in Nigeria, is expected to lay a 9 500 km fibre optic link to Lagos in 2009 later going to Accra, Ghana and Dakar, Senegal. The GL01 project, costing USD&nbsp;150&nbsp;million, is risky as the operator’s current traffic volume in Nigeria, Benin and Ghana does not justify the investment. MaIN One is another Nigerian project implemented by Mainstreet Technologies to link Portugal with Lagos and Accra by May 2010 with&nbsp;USD&nbsp;200 MBPS/month wholesale prices. The link is ultimately expected to go on to South Africa and cost USD&nbsp;865&nbsp;million. The West African Cable System (WACS) is supported by the largest operators in South Africa, MTN, Neotel, Telkom and Vodacom, which have traffic along the West coast. Only landing stations in Lagos and Accra are planned. </p> <p>The Africa Coast to Europe (ACE) project supported by France Telecom and 14 African operators is expected to connect France to Gabon by 2011. The cable will be built by a France Telecom-managed consortium. The Other Three&nbsp;billion (O3b) satellite, costing&nbsp;USD&nbsp;750&nbsp;million, is expected to be in service by 2010 with prices around&nbsp;USD&nbsp;700 MBPS/month. It will be able to <a href="http://www.africaneconomicoutlook.org/en/theme/ict-africa/technology-infrastructure-and-services-in-africa/box-7-connecting-the-other-3-billion/" title="Opens internal link in current window" class="internal-link">download web pages in 4 seconds</a>. NEPAD’s Uhurunet plan for an undersea fibre optic link around Africa does not have much support. Finally, Thales Alenia Space is constructing the first pan-African telecommunications satellite, Rascom. Originally planned for the 1990s, it is now only expected to provide services after 2010. The West African Festoon System (WAFS) aims to connect countries along the west coast from Nigeria to Namibia. It is expected to have the same governance structure as the SAT-3 cable and also be managed by Telkom SA so WAFS might not offer open access. </p> <p>Some alternative networks operate with mixed success. More than six electricity companies have received a licence to sell capacity directly or through another company. A 2&nbsp;000 km fibre optic cable is owned by Société Nationale d’Electricité (SNEL) in Democratic Republic of Congo. These have been badly hit by the country’s war. The World Bank is spending USD&nbsp;315&nbsp;million in Democratic Republic of Congo, including USD&nbsp;33&nbsp;million on a fibre-optic cable network. This could be expanded to other members of a proposed Southern African Energy Pool. Escom in Malawi will soon have fibre-optic cable links to Mozambique and the Tanzania Electric Supply Company (Tanesco) says it will build a new national grid with spare capacity used for telecommunications.</p><div class="csc-textpic csc-textpic-center csc-textpic-above"><div class="csc-textpic-imagewrap"><div class="csc-textpic-center-outer"><div class="csc-textpic-center-inner"><figure class="csc-textpic-image csc-textpic-last"><img src="csm_Overview_Part2_4_4cf7e875f5.jpg" alt="" title="Overview Part2 4"></figure></div></div></div></div><div class="csc-textpic csc-textpic-center csc-textpic-above"><div class="csc-textpic-imagewrap"><div class="csc-textpic-center-outer"><div class="csc-textpic-center-inner"><figure class="csc-textpic-image csc-textpic-last"><img src="csm_Overview_Part2_5_56d5370eee.jpg" alt="" title="Overview Part2 5"></figure></div></div></div></div><h2>Africa telecoms attract investors despite the financial crisis</h2><p>The financial crisis is likely to <a href="http://www.africaneconomicoutlook.org/en/theme/ict-africa/technology-infrastructure-and-services-in-africa/box-8-mobile-telephones-in-africa-the-impact-of-the-crisis/" title="Opens internal link in current window" class="internal-link">speed up consolidation of telecommunications markets</a> in Africa. While small operators struggle to finance network expansion, large cash-flush operators such as South Africa’s MTN, Egypt’s Orascom Telecom, Kuwait’s Zain, France’s Orange and UK’s Vodafone will be able to move in to African markets. Zain has increased its capital by USD&nbsp;4.49&nbsp;billion and says it will spend up to USD&nbsp;4&nbsp;billion in Africa before 2010. Business is still being done despite the crisis such as the sale of Ghana Telecom in August 2008, ONATEL in Burkina Faso in December 2008 and SOTELMA in Mali in January 2009. Millicom’s new licence in Rwanda was awarded in November 2008; Orange’s new licence in Togo in November 2008 and in Uganda in October 2008, and Orascom Telecom purchased Cell One Namibia in January 2009. </p> <p>Prospects for the future are uncertain however. The share price of mobile operators in Africa has fallen heavily: MTN by 20&nbsp;per cent this year and Millicom by 66&nbsp;per cent. With growth slowing for the past three years, price competition will increase, reducing the high profits that have sustained capital investment. This means third generation networks will be probably delayed. </p> <p>Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows into African telecommunications were not greatly affected by the internet bubble burst in 2000-2001, though only a small number of firms account for a large share of investment. Between 1996 and 2006 France’s Vivendi injected USD&nbsp;6.1 billon, France Telecom USD&nbsp;4.9&nbsp;billion and Vodafone of the UK USD&nbsp;3.4&nbsp;billion. South-South investments came from Kuwait’s Mobile Telecommunications Co. with&nbsp;USD&nbsp;4.9&nbsp;billion, South Africa’s MTN with USD&nbsp;4.5&nbsp;billion and Egypt’s Orascom with USD&nbsp;3.7&nbsp;billion. More recently, China has offered soft loans to state-owned telecommunications operators. Chinese equipments suppliers such as Huawei and ZTE are probably going to increase their presence in Africa. </p> <p>The current crisis will probably have less impact on FDI for telecommunications because of Africa’s large potential market and the relatively low impact of the crisis on consumers.</p><div class="csc-textpic csc-textpic-center csc-textpic-above"><div class="csc-textpic-imagewrap"><div class="csc-textpic-center-outer"><div class="csc-textpic-center-inner"><figure class="csc-textpic-image csc-textpic-last"><img src="csm_Overview_Part2_6_a90a96ae1b.jpg" alt="" title="Overview Part2 6"></figure></div></div></div></div><!--TYPO3SEARCH_end--><div class="clear"></div><p class="top"><a href="http://www.africaneconomicoutlook.org/en/theme/ict-africa/technology-infrastructure-and-services-in-africa/#">Top</a></p></div> </div> <div class="columnThree column page"> <div class="columnWrapper page"><div id="secondaryNavigation"><div id="secondaryNavigationWrapper"><ul class="navigation vertical"><li class="first"><a href="http://www.africaneconomicoutlook.org/en/theme/global-value-chains-and-africas-industrialisation/" title="Global Value Chains and Africa's Industrialisation"><span>Global Value Chains and Africa's Industrialisation (2014)</span></a></li><li><a href="http://www.africaneconomicoutlook.org/en/theme/structural-transformation-and-natural-resources/" title="Structural Transformation and Natural Resources"><span>Structural Transformation &amp;
