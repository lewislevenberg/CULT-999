The Research ICT Africa Network conducts research on ICT policy and  regulation that facilitates evidence-based and informed policy making  for improved access, use and application of ICT for social development  and economic growth.

<span class="article-heading" style="margin: 55px 0px 15px;">Mission</span>
RIA conducts public-interest research on ICT policy and regulation  that responds to national, regional and continental needs. It provides  African researchers, governments, regulators, operators, multilateral  institutions, development agencies, community organizations and trade  unions with the information and analysis required to develop innovative  and appropriate policies, effective implementation and successful  network operations that can contribute to sustainable development. The  network will contribute to the gathering of up to date ICT data and  establish repository of information for furthering research and policy  formulation. The programme will promote interaction between researchers  and their peers at national, regional and international levels to  harmonize methodologies, tools and standards for conducting  public-interest ICT policy research.<br>
<br>
<strong><span class="heading">Research ICT Africa consists of a network of researchers in 20 African countries:</span></strong><br>
