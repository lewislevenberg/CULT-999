<p><strong>iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Objectives of NIX </strong></p>
<p>NIX has two primary objectives.</p>
<p>1. To provide efficient interconnectivity within the Federal Republic of Nigeria for the Internet (Core Activity)</p>
<p>2. To promote the interests of its members (Non-Core Activity)<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legal Structure of NIX</strong></p>
<p>NIX is run as a Nigerian company limited by guarantee. All members of NIX are members of this company and are bound by the Company's Memorandum and Articles of Association set out in Clause 16 of this document. Associate members are bound by such rules and regulations as the members from time to time determine.</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prerequisites to apply to become a NIX member </strong></p>
<p>There are four main prerequisites to becoming a NIX member:</p>
<p>1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Candidates for membership shall be a&nbsp;recognised&nbsp;legal entity</p>
<p>1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Candidates for membership shall have an ASN (Autonomous System Number) and use BGP4+ for peering. A private ASN can be used subject to a maximum period of three (3) months.</p>
<p>1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;The candidates’ business shall include the Internet transmission of third party content or services</p>
<p>1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Where such business requires a license for operation in the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the candidate must posses such license</p>
<p>These prerequisites, and all other terms and conditions laid out in this MoU, including but not limited to those referenced in member responsibilities (Clause 3), achievement of full membership status (Clause 4) and the technical requirements (Appendix 1), constitute continuing requirements for NIX members. Failure to maintain these prerequisites may lead to non-compliance under Clause 6 of this MoU.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsibilities and services to be provided by NIX</strong></p>
<p>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;The day-to-day running of NIX is carried out by NIX Chief Executive Officer and NIX staff. Affairs of NIX are overseen by the Board.</p>
<p>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;NIX shall only monitor any port/connection where:</p>
<p>2.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This information is required by law; or</p>
<p>2.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information gathered is generic in nature and is harvested solely for statistical or network management purposes only; or</p>
<p>2.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The board reasonably believes a violation of this MoU has occurred.</p>
<p>2.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NIX agrees that it shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that any monitoring will neither adversely affect the services rendered to a member nor compromise member confidentiality.</p>
<p>2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;NIX shall not undertake new projects or offer new services, outside of NIX's core business of peering facilitation, which would be competitive to those of its members.</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are expected, if requested, to contribute towards the running of NIX by providing volunteer assistance. NIX agrees to provide adequate notice (which shall include an estimate of required resources) along with details of the work required, before it starts. Members agree to make reasonable efforts to provide the requested assistance.</p>
<p>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Members shall ensure that all contact information which is held by NIX in connection with their membership is correct and kept up-to-date, specifically:</p>
<p>3.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members shall provide 24x7 operational contact details for the use of NIX staff and other members. The personnel available by this means shall understand the requirements of this Memorandum of Understanding and shall be able to speak and understand spoken and written English or to have immediate access to other personnel who are able to speak and understand spoken and written English. Failure to provide this information may be regarded as "Non-Compliance" in accordance with Clause 6 of this MoU.</p>
<p>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Members must endorse and implement the Mandatory Multi-Lateral Peering Agreement (MMLPA) of the Exchange. Failure to do so would be regarded as "Non-Compliance" in accordance with Clause 6 of this MoU.</p>
<p>3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Members shall not refer their customers or any agent of their customers, directly to NIX support staff unless specifically sanctioned by a member of NIX staff by email.</p>
<p>3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Members shall ensure that at least one member of their staff is subscribed to the following mailing lists:</p>

<p>Failure to do so would be regarded as "Non-Compliance" in accordance with Clause 6 of this MoU.</p>
<p>NIX and all other members and associate members are entitled to assume, and to act, as if each member and associate member reads and appropriately deals with messages as sent to these lists. NIX may, for the protection of its own infrastructure, take such reasonable and proportionate action as is necessary if this is not the case.</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Membership Status</strong></p>
<p>4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;A prospective member is required to submit an application for NIX membership, which can be completed and submitted online or by email attachment. The application is available online at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nixp.net/join/application_form.htm">http://www.nixp.net/join/application_form.htm</a></p>
<p>4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;A prospective member shall be granted temporary member status upon:</p>
<p>4.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prospective member's application being successful; and</p>
<p>4.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prospective member paying the fees set out in the invoice generated following the submission of such application (which should include the joining fee and the pro-rated membership fee and pro-rated port charge); and</p>
<p>4.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prospective member's compliance with the Joining Procedure</p>
<p>4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;As a prerequisite to obtaining full membership status, the temporary member must comply with the Joining Procedure of NIX within one (1) month of being granted temporary membership. Failure to do so may result in temporary membership status being withdrawn and it shall be necessary for the new member to re-apply for NIX membership. In this event any fees paid to date shall be deemed to be non-refundable and any subsequent membership application shall incur additional fees as per Clause 9 of this document.</p>
<p>4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;A connection to NIX shall only proceed after:</p>
<p>4.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NIX has received a copy of this MoU signed by anauthorised&nbsp;representative of the temporary member;</p>
<p>4.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NIX has received a copy of the MMLPA signed by an authorised representative of the temporary member; and</p>
<p>4.4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NIX has received a connection form from the temporary member, duly completed and giving all information required therein - see Clause 16 "References"</p>
<p>4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;A temporary member shall only be deemed to have full membership status including voting rights once they meet all the requirements listed above and have achieved and maintained operational peering with NIX route servers and all existing NIX members. This shall be confirmed to the Chief Executive Officer via email to the address &lt;
